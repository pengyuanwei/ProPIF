# GUIDE

# Installation:

To run this project, we strongly recommend that you use Conda-Mamba to manage the python environment. 

**NOTE**: We used RoboStack with ROS2-Humble for this project.

Create a new env and install the dependencies:

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
conda activate propif_ros2
```

To download and install lightglue ensure that the terminal env is propif_ros2 (in any folder you like):
```
git clone https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue.git && cd LightGlue
python -m pip install -e .
```

To download and install [Hierarchical-Localization](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization) (HLoc), type following command in any folder you like:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization/
cd Hierarchical-Localization/
python -m pip install -e .
```

**NOTE**: Since HLoc is using exactly pycolmap=0.6.0, we recommand you re-install pycolmap=0.6.0:

```
pip install --force-reinstall pycolmap==0.6.0
```

To download and install [CuRobo](https://curobo.org/), type following command in any folder you like:

```
sudo apt install git-lfs
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo.git
cd curobo
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation # This will take 20 minutes to install
```

To download and install [Simulation and Control](https://github.com/VModugno/simulation_and_control/tree/dce4c1da3c28a636a5723bdea38a9de8b1224559), type following command in any folder you like:

```
git clone https://github.com/VModugno/simulation_and_control.git
cd simulation_and_control
pip install .
```

# Pre-Execution

After installing all the dependencies above, you need to perform a one-time environment setup before running the project. This setup is only required once unless the environment is changed or rebuilt.

Reinstall all colcon-related packages and rebuild colcon.

```
mamba activate propif_ros2  # conda activate is the same
for pkg in $(mamba list | grep colcon | awk '{print $1}'); do mamba remove -y $pkg; done
mamba install colcon-common-extensions  # if it fails, use pip
cd YOUR_PATH/ProPIF/propif_ros2
rm -rf build/ install/ log/
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

# Execution

We provide a launch file for you to launch control node, perception node and simulation node together.

Cd to ProPif directory and type following commands to startup a pybullet simulation for this project and launch all 3 nodes.

```
cd propif_ros2
colcon build
source install/setup.bash # change to setup.zsh if you are using zsh
ros2 launch propif_bringup system.launch.py
```

You can also launch 3 nodes seperately:

```
cd propif_ros2
colcon build
```

Now start up 3 terminals, terminal A, B and C.

Inside Terminal A, to start simulation node. Cd to ProPif/propif_ros2, then:

```
source install/setup.bash # change to setup.zsh if you are using zsh
ros2 launch propif_simulation simulation.launch.py 
```

Inside Terminal B, to start control node. Cd to ProPif/propif_ros2, then:

```
source install/setup.bash # change to setup.zsh if you are using zsh
ros2 launch propif_control control.launch.py 
```

Inside Terminal C, to start perception node. Cd to ProPif/propif_ros2, then:

```
source install/setup.bash # change to setup.zsh if you are using zsh
ros2 launch propif_perception perception.launch.py 
```

## Appendix

### Path Modifications

You need to modify a few paths to correctly load the model/config:

- In `configs/pandaconfig.yaml`, on **line 5**, change the path to:  
  `{Your_Work_Space}/models/panda_description/panda.urdf`

- In the **control node**, on **line 30**, change the path to:  
  `{Your_Work_Space}/configs/pandaconfig.yaml`

- In the **simulation node**, on **lines 93 and 115**, set the **config directory** to your **workspace directory**.

To better monitor the status of each node, the current bringup launch includes only two nodes (**simulation** and **control**). The perception node prints out many outputs from YOLO, I have no idea how to mute it so I split it out.
You need to use **two terminals** to fully run the project.

One for bringup launch:

```
ros2 launch propif_bringup system.launch.py
```

One for perception node launch:

```
ros2 launch propif_perception perception.launch.py
```
